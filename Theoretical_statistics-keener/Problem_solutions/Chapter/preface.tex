This note contains the solution of the problems in the textbook, {\em Theoretical Statistics: Topics for a Core Course}, and it was created by Hyunsung Kim, who is a Ph.D. student.
I wrote it when I study a theoretical statistics based on this textbook on my own by solving some problems and also referred to the solution manual in the textbook.

It contains a few selected problems in the textbook what I studied, and also note that it may not be the exact solutions.
If you want to refer to this note, you should study with doubt about the answer.
